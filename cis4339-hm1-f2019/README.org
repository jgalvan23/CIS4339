* Homework 1 Instructions

Clone this code to your computer and make the following changes. When you are finished,
zip the entire directory and submit it to Blackboard.

- Change the title at the top of the Dogs index page to "My Dogs"
- Add a header (as demonstrated in class) that shows up on all pages with an h1 tag with the text "<Your name here>'s Dog Management System"

[NOTE]
-- 
Massive points off if you don't replace <Your name here> with your actual name :-)
--

- Add CSS to the header to make it prettier - your choice of colors
- On the show page, where you see information for just one dog at a time, change the title to "Dog: {@dog.name}"
